I	would	say	both	,	in	fact	,	because	the	first	play	that	he	wrote	that	made	him	famous	was	a	play	that	dates	from	1981	,	which	was	actually	called	`	Bus	Stop	'	,	which	many	people	said	was	based	on	the	play	or	had	resonances	from	Beckett	's	play	`	Waiting	for	Godot	'	and	it	concerned	a	number	of	Chinese	people	from	different	walks	of	life	who	were	standing	at	a	bus	stop	waiting	for	a	bus	that	never	came	.

So	,	we	can	see	immediately	that	the	resonances	with	the	play	of	Beckett	,	but	Gao	Xingjian	really	before	1989	felt	that	he	was	restricted	,	that	he	was	unable	to	write	and	to	have	his	plays	produced	,	as	he	would	wish	,	and	so	left	China	couple	of	years	before	the	incident	at	Tiananmen	in	1989	.
