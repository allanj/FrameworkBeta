<h1> StatNLP Projects
==================

This package contains the work implemented using the [**StatNLP**](http://statnlp.org/) framework and we will keep updating to make it more efficient. Most of the project implemented with the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model in Java. 



### Current projects in this package

- [Dependency-guided Named Entity Recognition](#ddd)
  - associated with the paper _Efficient Dependency-Guided Named Entity Recognition_, to be appeared in AAAI 2017
- Dependency Parsing
- Named Entity Recognition with Linear-chain CRFs and semi-Markov CRFs.
- Part-of-Speech Tagging and Chunking with Linear-chain CRFs
- Factorial CRFs (_ongoing_)
